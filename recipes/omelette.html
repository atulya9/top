    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        Omelettes are the most requested breakfast in our house and 99% of the time we always have the ingredients in the refrigerator.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cheese (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat eggs - in a small bowl, combine 2 eggs and a pinch of salt then beat with a fork until frothy</li>
            <li>Heat skillet - place a small non-stick pan over medium heat and melt in 1/2 Tbsp of butter. Once butter is melted and bubbly, add beaten eggs and reduce heat to low.</li>
            <li>Pull cooked eggs with a spatula into the center, allowing the liquid eggs to fill in the space. Watch the video tutorial above to see this process in action.</li>
            <li>Flip - once eggs are nearly set, the omelette slides easily on the skillet and you can get a spatula underneath, flip it over. Turn off the heat. </li>
            <li>Fold â€“ add cheese and your favorite toppings, fold the omlette and slide it onto a plate to serve.</li>
        </ol>
